**taste**

*skincare*
round lab birch sunscreen, adapalene, PKY calming cream/balm, FANCL cleansing oil

- for skincare my general advice is to start from first principles. my skin is oily/rosacea prone and through much experimentation I found the best approach focuses on restoration and not suppressing symptoms. madecassoside + ceramides are king, the only brand that mixes them well with minimal irritation and fragrances is PKY. sunscreens round lab works pretty well, torriden is fine as well. about to try the haruharu black rice one perhaps it will be good? double cleaning is also super important, the muji oil is actually better than the manyo imo since it doesn't hurt if you get it in your eyes. FANCL is even better tho. to get rid of acne just use adapalene for a while, actually magic. 

*fragrance*
current: edit(h) earl grey/diptyque philosykos
previous: d'annam white rice, one day taipei

- originally got into fragrances for a very shallow reason, but ended up falling in love with them once I realized how what is literally scented water can completely change your mood. started with blue masculine mens fragrances, then went through a white musk/floral phase, green herbal/botanical, now exploring masculine scents again but with a more nuanced and fresh perspective. really crazy how the same outfit can be radically different based on what fragrance you pair with it, trying to pare my collection down to 4 max ideally just one. 
- the previous fragrances I no longer use would be perfect for someone who loves light academia, trust me on that

*designers (aesthetically)*
ralph lauren, christophe lemaire, hengdi wang, jil sander, auralee, hedi slimane, ricardo tisci

- ralph lauren is the GOAT. somehow makes clothes that basically everybody looks good in. 
- if you like Uniqlo, you need to know that Christophe Lemaire is the person behind the entire Uniqlo U line. Lemaire is literally Uniqlo U but designer level in quality, fabrics, cut and color. 
- Hengdi Wang is the only person who scratches my Dune itch, his clothes are actually surreal. if liquid chrome aespa is y3k, hengdi wang is y4k when we've built programmable clothing and become an interplanetary species
- auralee is great, auralee is good. auralee would be perfect, IF THEY WOULD MAKE MORE CLOTHES IN BLACK
- Jil Sander is simply clean. wow. if only the blazers didn't cost 5k a piece.
- Hedi Slimane and Ricardo Tisci are the ones who inspired by affinity for all black clothing, and also made me pay what I previously thought was an obscene amount of money for clothes. if you respect art, try to get designer. you don't need it new, thrift most of this stuff anyways because they don't work for the same houses anymore and it's just not the same. 

*music*
[interlude](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5v1tMzsmgkl74RJqBQg6k6?si=9ba56265275f4713), [de riguer](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/25joSIRu2FhDW7FEsMGo7B?si=1374937d1c2b4e7c), [nugaze](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ry66l9yXac9MTOMstG3tE?si=e0db3025b67041fa), [idlewild](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7xr9doOPJ4RhgoG2FgB2ho?si=0da514ba9e514184), [shanghai](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Gpml8BWVwkicfreHAwKlm?si=ead7095a41a8477b)

- **interlude**: yearning.
- **de riguer**: all or nothing. the brighter a star shines, the faster it's burning. 
- **nugaze**: sunset at a random park in SF thinking about the past.
- **idlewild**: late night drives, after hours at a bar, running through the streets laughing deliriously as the world spins in a million directions.
- **shanghai**: soloing boutiques during the day, becoming one with the rhythm of a city.
