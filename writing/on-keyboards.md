# on keyboards and gesture interfaces

keyboards are reductivistic and need to be made obsolete. technology should not constrain our instincts, and instead be built around them. the keyboard has been around for less than 150 years, compared to gestures which we have been doing for over 10,000. you should be able to control any content on screens through pure head/hand movement without additional haptic hardware.

unironically this would be really great for accessibility.
