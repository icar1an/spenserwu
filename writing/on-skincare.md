# on skincare

I've already been asked by multiple people to un-gatekeep everything that I've learned about skincare and help them with product recommendations. This, I feel, is the best way to democratize all my knowledge, because gatekeeping things are for losers.

Let's start with the basics. The first, most important thing about skincare is understanding your skin type, because you can spend all the money on products, you could go get fancy treatments, do everything that you could do with money, and still completely mess up because you don't understand your skin type.
There are a few different ones. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head:

- Oily
- Normal
- Combi
- Rosacea
- Acne Prone

There are also hybrids, where you have people who have dry patches and normal skin elsewhere, and oily skin elsewhere. Just really try and spend a lot of time understanding your skincare. There are fantastic resources on the Internet, but anecdotally I can say that I know for sure I have very oily skin, because by the end of the day I look like somebody rubbed a layer of argan oil all over my face. That's just the way my skin is; it's oily, so I get products that are best for oily skin.

Also mention a few things about products here. There are going to be people who say, "Oh, get all your stuff from Korea," or "Get all your stuff from La Roche Posay," or any binary rule. I would say definitely ignore all of that. Naturally, some skin care brands are going to have more chemistry when you mix products from the same line, because they were meant to be used together. I'd say, when you're first starting out, you don't really know what works for you, so you should spend a lot of time exploring.

Then again, this is the optimization, or what is it called? It's not optimization; it's the multi-armed bandit problem in operations research. When you don't know what works best for you, you should spend a lot of time exploring before you settle down and commit to a few options. That's just the most rational thing you should do. 

So once you've spent time and figured out your skin type, here's another really good rule to stick by: less is more. Don't go buy like 15 different serums and three different creams; it's completely unnecessary. Try and keep your routine and stack as minimal as possible because there's always new stuff coming out in skincare. There's always probably going to be a product out there in the world that works better for you at any given point in time.

If you commit really heavily to having tons of different ingredients and they mix together in certain ratios, it can lead to adverse side effects. For example if you have a serum with niacinamide in it that's 10%, but your cream that you apply to your face could also have 5 or 6% niacinamide. Even though individually those things are fine on their own, when you mix them together it's going to have an adverse side reaction on your face. You're going to think that it was one product when in reality it was just mixing two things that were incompatible.

This would be more of a: try and keep the amount of actives that you use in your skincare routine as minimal as possible. Please do not be doing an acid AHA/BHA peel with very aggressive exfoliation and then you do adapalene. You're going to completely destroy your skin barrier. 

Just a warning that some actives like niacinamide or just adapalene, any form of retinol. You have retinol and retinoid there; they all accomplish the same thing. There are vitamin A derivatives that increase cell turnover on your face. In the beginning they have purge phases.

Honestly if you think you need adapalene, just start with adapalene. Don't go crazy. You don't need to go to a dermatologist. If you do go see a dermatologist, probably know more about this than I do. I just refuse to go see a dermatologist because I wanted to figure this all out myself and I think I did.

Anyways adapalene is great. It's the only topical retinoid that you can get. 0.1% is the absolute strongest over-the-counter concentration that you can get and it works magic. In the beginning there will be purge phases. Be prepared to slather your face with ceramide creams multiple times. I did it during the winter of my freshman year here at Cornell and that was brutal. I literally carry a round of CeraVe cream with me and I'd be slathering that on my face multiple times because it literally felt like it was on fire. You stick through that shit and your face is going to be baby smooth by the end of it. My face used to feel all rocky and pocketed and then now it's like baby smooth, all because of adapalene. 

Another really important thing for my skin in general, or a massive win, was ceramides. The first time I ever got into ceramides was through Ceravis cream but that is way too heavy because they put mineral oil in it. You could put it on during the winter but during the summer it is absolute overkill. Your face will feel greasy and heavy and it was honestly not the best product. It worked during the winter but only at night and when I wake up in the morning I want something to put on my face. I couldn't use that cream because it was way too heavy, so I looked at the active ingredients and realized that NP ceramide was the most important ingredient. That's how I even came across Pyunkang Yule, which is the skincare brand that I obsessively recommend to essentially anyone looking for a simple skincare stack that solves the vast majority of their problems. They do a line for normal skin, combination skin, acne-prone skin, everything's great, minimal ingredients. It was from a Korean hospital that just ended up making their own brand. They don't do any advertisements whatsoever, and it's been completely fantastic.

First principles, starting with ceramides, because there are, I think, three different types of ceramides that can nourish your skin barrier. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head, but they're great because they're just fatty lipids that go directly into your skin barrier. They absorb well, and if your skin's oily, you might think, "Wait, why would I put more ceramides onto my face? Shouldn't my face have enough?" Well, if you do put ceramides on your face, your skin will be moisturized and therefore will produce less oil, because producing oil is a reaction to your skin being a little dry.
