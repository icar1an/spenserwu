*oct 2021*

I open my eyes and find myself in the heart of a rolling grassland. The landscape is dotted with tufts of colorful wildflowers, under a blue sky filled with sheets of soft clouds. From a distance, a herd of wild horses gallops in my direction. Suddenly, an unsettling tremor ripples through the ground. Before I can react, the earth splits open beneath my feet. I'm swallowed by the resulting abyss, my bones shatter, and my vision goes dark.

"You are not executing the technique correctly."

Jarred from my daymare, I stare blankly at my sheet music.

"Your body is tense. Relax, try again."

The voice of my erhu teacher, Mr. Lin, coaxes me back to reality; I'm failing to play the last line of my piece, "Galloping in the Great Grasslands." Resting in my hands is my erhu, a traditional Chinese string instrument. It consists of a wooden frame, a horsehair bow, and a hexagonal soundbox covered by a layer of python skin on one side. My instrument looks deceptively simple, almost primitive. Yet even a decade later, its mellow, evocative, and almost human tone still connects me to my Chinese heritage. In preparation for an upcoming competition, Mr. Lin began teaching me how to mimic the sound of a horse neighing. It is one of the instrument's signature techniques, and I had been struggling with it for months.

I try again. I fail again -- my erhu screeches in pain. The sharp sound slices through the air, and I grimace.

Mr. Lin tries to encourage me. "Your bow must ricochet against the outer string to create the neighing. Keep practicing, you cannot force this."

My face pressed against the passenger window during my drive home, I stared into the distance, lost in thought. What was I missing? Practicing intensely only made the technique more confusing; applying extra rosin left me cleaning sticky layers of white powder from my erhu. My instrument spluttered regardless of my efforts, and my daymares continued. The date of the competition crawled ever closer, and I consulted Mr. Lin once again.

"Spenser, this technique, ma jiao sheng, is what brings this piece together. You must do it well."

"I've been practicing this piece for at least two years now, what difference could one ma jiao sheng possibly make?"

After a long pause, Mr. Lin replied. "Play the last part again."

I played the section, deliberately omitting the horse neighing.

"When you sacrifice small details, you lose the essence of the music. This is a song about a grassland. If you leave out ma jiao sheng, the horses will fade, the grass will wilt, and the sky will crumble."

I grip my erhu tightly, and begin playing again.

Once again in the grassland, the same herd of horses begins galloping toward me. I run my hand along the edge of the previous chasm and feel a new tremor growing in power. As the rumbling intensifies, I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I glide my bow down my erhu, and it softly ricochets off the outside string. It makes a gentle neighing sound, a stark contrast to my previous attempts. As I shout with joy, I see Mr. Lin smiling proudly. I turn my head, just in time to watch the last few horses gallop towards the horizon.

I never expected to find beauty within the details of my piece. Working together with Mr. Lin in the pursuit of mastery made me draw upon parts of myself that I didn't know existed. To understand the story behind a piece I had been playing for years, to feel both triumph and peace as time melts away, that experience is unparalleled. Now when I close my eyes, I can finally hear horses neighing in the great grasslands. And I know that I can follow them towards the rising sun.
