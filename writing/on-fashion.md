ralph lauren is the GOAT. somehow makes clothes that basically everybody looks good in.

if you like Uniqlo, you need to know that Christophe Lemaire is the person behind the entire Uniqlo U line. Lemaire is literally Uniqlo U but designer level in quality, fabrics, cut and color.

Hengdi Wang is the only person who scratches my Dune itch, his clothes are actually surreal. if liquid chrome aespa is y3k, hengdi wang is y4k when we've built programmable clothing and become an interplanetary species.

auralee is great, auralee is good. auralee would be perfect, IF THEY WOULD MAKE MORE CLOTHES IN BLACK.

Jil Sander is simply clean. wow. if only the blazers didn't cost 5k a piece.

Hedi Slimane and Ricardo Tisci are the ones who inspired by affinity for all black clothing, and also made me pay what I previously thought was an obscene amount of money for clothes. if you respect art, try to get designer. you don't need it new, thrift most of this stuff anyways because they don't work for the same houses anymore and it's just not the same.
