# on fragrance

originally got into fragrances for a very shallow reason, but ended up falling in love with them once I realized how what is literally scented water can completely change your mood. started with blue masculine mens fragrances, then went through a white musk/floral phase, green herbal/botanical, now exploring masculine scents again but with a more nuanced and fresh perspective. really crazy how the same outfit can be radically different based on what fragrance you pair with it, trying to pare my collection down to 4 max ideally just one.

the previous fragrances I no longer use would be perfect for someone who loves light academia, trust me on that.
