# on building for virality

originally was working with @BenKoppe on adtech, but we got distracted by instagram reels during a roadblock.

thesis: in the age where anyone can build anything, distribution is king. unless you have money to burn on marketing or are an influencer already/know ones willing to work for free in a relevant niche, you have to build products to enable repeatable content with virality potential. once you cultivate an audience, you ship your actual product.

we spent a while thinking about what would look the most goofy on reels, to which I suggested someone playing the chrome dino game with their face. only thought of this because of this guy named @aaronka4n on reels who used CV to make scripts that fetched images/quizzes. if that's possible then there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to play the chrome game with your head. tbh stuff like the arcteryx detector is a waste of DDR5 ram.

quickly built a working prototype of the chrome dino game in 30 minutes, then immediately started working on making it work for subway surfers. we got it so good in one night that we went around campus doing user testing on random people at 1am. reception was crazy, it was my first time making a product that people actually wanted.

ended up skipping class the next day to rapidly improve head mode with auto tracking + perfecting the sensitivity thresholds. this is also when I had the sage realization that if it works for subway surfers, you can scroll ig reels with it too lol.

it was also really easy to test this product and perfect it by using it, since the way you do that is by watching short form content/playing internet games to fine tune the settings.

Ben got it into an auto updating dmg, we speedran the website and also started building gesturebinds + hand control modes using fingertip tracking. cue more UI/UX improvements through pure feeling and intuition for what a product like this should be like.

built wink controls, auditory feedback (so so satisfying), and also ended up consolidating some of the detected modes.

the beauty of head.surf is that it's so stupid the product literally markets itself. you can film infinite UGC by using it to scroll brainrot or play games in lectures, or even scroll multiple reels at once which is simply disgusting.
