# on fashion tech

my eLab project was for fashiontech, but appdev on that front was taking too long so I ended up shipping a chrome extension to validate if the market wanted a product like this.

the CTR on this is insane currently ranging from 2-6%, I'm guessing this is because when people use it (they don't know how to dress like a certain outfit/aesthetic) they have an incredibly malleable window in their head for product placements.

it originally had terrible CTR but then I changed the highest price by default to 150 and sorted all fetched items from low to high, this came from the sage realization that someone with serious money would hire a stylist instead of downloading a chrome extension.

thesis: unless you have insane distribution/credibility in the industry, DO NOT try to build fashiontech. nobody needs the 2892 wardrobe/OOTD app or "tinder for clothes", just spend more money on clothes and learn how to get clothes from ebay/grailed/depop/vinted/vestaire collective/the realreal. you cannot shortcut the taste acquisition process, downloading apps to become more fashionable is like reading the sparknotes for tolstoy and expecting to be on par with someone who read the actual book multiple times. it's ridiculous, naive, and incredibly low signal.
